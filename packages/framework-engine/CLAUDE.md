# Agent guide — packages/framework-engine

`@k8ordo/framework-engine` — the machinery `@k8ordo/static` and
`@k8ordo/server` are both built on. **Internal**: applications install a mode
package, never this one. It is published only so those two can resolve it.

The framework's job is to make the application's structure a checkable form:
`routes/` is the pathname space and holds nothing else, execution boundaries
are declared with React's own `'use client'` and enforced, and the type wiring
between the app and `@k8ordo/router` / `@k8ordo/state` is generated rather
than hand-written. The shared discipline (React 19 / RSC assumed, Baseline
newly available only) is in the repository root's [`CLAUDE.md`](../../CLAUDE.md).

## Commands

```bash
pnpm test          # unit (node)
pnpm build         # vp pack
pnpm typecheck
pnpm check         # check:write to auto-fix
```

## The invariants

- **The filesystem stays at the edge.** `parseRouteTree` is a pure function
  over a list of paths, so the grammar's rules are what get tested, never the
  disk. Anything that reads directories is a thin wrapper around it.
- **Every problem is reported, not just the first.** Parsing collects
  `Problem[]` and returns them with a best-effort tree; the plugin decides how
  to present them. A build that fails should name everything wrong at once.
- **One structure, two consumers.** `buildTable` builds the route table
  generically over what a route file resolves to — identifiers when emitting
  source, real components when a test hands the result to the router's own
  `defineRoutes`. That is why the integration test can prove the emitted table
  matches correctly without evaluating generated text.
- **The generated table is ordinary source.** It uses the router's public API
  and would be identical to what someone wrote by hand from the same
  directories — reviewable in a diff, with no private hooks into the router.
- **Declaration order is load-bearing.** `not-found.tsx` is emitted last in
  its branch because the router matches in declaration order; every route the
  app actually declared has to out-rank the catch-all.

## Conventions

- `type`, not `interface`; comments explain why the straightforward version
  was not used.
- Tests state a guarantee in their name, English; comments and commits are
  Japanese except docs/ and this file.
