### A tab opened before a deploy

A tab keeps running the script it loaded, while every payload it fetches
comes from whatever is deployed now — and a new deploy may render a client
component that script has never heard of. So every payload names the client
it was rendered for, the URL of the script its page's HTML loads, and one
that names another script is never rendered: the navigation becomes a
document load of the same URL, and the visitor gets the new page with the
script that can render it instead of `error.tsx`. Under `@k8ordo/server` a
Server Action's answer is held to the same rule: the page is loaded again
rather than the answer applied.

The bundler hashes into that URL everything the script can load, so a deploy
that changed nothing the browser runs leaves every open tab navigating in
place, and servers built apart from the same source agree.
